# Device Onbording

My personal dotfiles for **macOS, Linux, and Windows**, plus a `setup.sh`
bootstrap that provisions a fresh machine (packages + system tweaks) and deploys
these configs.

The repo lives at an **external** path (e.g. `~/.dotfiles`), **not** at
`~/.config`. On macOS/Linux it deploys config *into* `~/.config` by per-app
**symlink** (`~/.config/<app>` → `~/.dotfiles/<tier>/<app>`), so editing through
the symlink is still editing the repo. Windows has no single `~/.config`, so it
deploys by an explicit manifest to per-app targets (see below).

## Layout

Content is split into OS **tiers**; the OS is chosen at runtime via `uname`:

- `macos/` — the macOS machine: `zsh/`, `zed/`, `ghostty/`, `aerospace/`,
  `linearmouse/`, `vivaldi/`, `bin/`, `micro/`, `starship.toml`, and its own
  `setup/` (`brew`, `tweak`).
- `linux/` — the Linux (Arch/CachyOS) machine: `fish/`, `hypr/`, `waybar/`,
  `kitty/`, `mako/`, `rofi/`, `swaylock/`, `nvim/`, `btop/`, `tmux/`, `gtk-*`,
  `qt5ct/`, `qt6ct/`, `zed/`, `micro/`, `mimeapps.list`, and its own `setup/`
  (`pacman`, `yay`, `flatpak`, `app`, `asdf`, `tweak`).
- `windows/` — the native-Windows (Git Bash/MSYS) machine: its `setup/`
  (`winget`, `tweak`) and a `.links` deploy manifest. Selected when `uname -s`
  reports `MINGW*`/`MSYS*`/`CYGWIN*` (WSL reports `Linux` → the `linux` tier).
  Currently a stub — cascade + deploy plumbing, no app configs yet.
- `lib/link.sh` — the shared symlink helper (bootstrap code, not config).
- Repo meta at the root (`setup.sh`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, …)
  is never symlinked into `~/.config`.

There is no `common/` tier: genuinely-shared config (`micro/`, and `zed/` with a
per-tier `settings.json`) is duplicated into both tiers by design.

## Bootstrap

Clone anywhere and run `setup.sh` — there is no in-place mode; it always deploys
by symlink.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdrianLSY/config.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
```

`setup.sh`:

1. **Refuses to run as root** — never `sudo ./setup.sh`.
2. **Detects the OS** via `uname -s` and selects the `macos`, `linux`, or
   `windows` tier (errors on anything else).
3. On Windows, runs a **preflight** (before any change): errors out if `winget`
   is missing or a native symlink can't be created (Developer Mode off).
4. Runs a **repo-scoped, mode-preserving** `chmod u+rwX` (never touches
   `~/.config` or `.git`, and never flips git-tracked file modes — a bootstrap
   leaves `git status` clean).
5. On macOS, **ensures Command Line Tools** (git + clang, which Homebrew needs).
6. **Deploys the tier's configs** — macOS/Linux symlink each app dir into
   `~/.config` via backup-then-link (skipping the reserved `setup/`); Windows
   links each app to its manifest destination (`windows/.links`).
7. Runs the tier's `setup/.setup.sh` cascade (macOS: `brew` → `tweak`; Linux:
   `pacman` → `yay` → `flatpak` → `app` → `asdf` → `tweak`; Windows: `winget` →
   `tweak`), then exits with the cascade's true status. The runners provision
   what a fresh machine lacks: the macOS runner puts brew on `PATH` for the
   tweak phase (a first run from a stock terminal works end-to-end), the
   flatpak runner adds the `flathub` remote, and the asdf runner creates
   `~/.tool-versions`.

### Backup-then-link (safe on a machine with an existing `~/.config`)

For each app dir/file in the tier, `setup.sh`:

- **leaves it alone** if `~/.config/<app>` is already the correct symlink (no-op);
- **backs it up** to `<app>.bak.<timestamp>` if a real dir/file or a different
  symlink is in the way, then creates the symlink;
- **creates the symlink** if nothing is there.

Nothing is ever overwritten without a timestamped backup, and **unmanaged
`~/.config` entries** (`gh/`, `uv/`, `raycast/`, …) are never touched. Re-running
is idempotent. To roll back an app: remove its symlink and restore the `.bak.<ts>`.

The same rule extends to the tweaks: the macOS zsh tweak backs up a
pre-existing `~/.zshrc`/`~/.zprofile` to `<file>.bak.<timestamp>` instead of
deleting it, and a re-run of the whole bootstrap makes zero changes — no new
backups, no package reinstalls, and a clean `git status` in the repo.

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** — Command Line Tools (git + clang); `setup.sh` installs them for you;
  if the automated install stalls, run `xcode-select --install` and re-run.
- **Linux** — a working `pacman` (CachyOS/Arch base) is assumed; the bootstrap
  installs `yay` and the rest.
- **Windows** — install **Git for Windows** (Git Bash) and the **`winget`
  client** (App Installer / Windows Package Manager), and enable **Developer
  Mode** (Settings → Privacy & security → For developers) so native symlinks can
  be created without elevation. Then clone to `~/.dotfiles` and run
  `./setup.sh` **from Git Bash**. The preflight verifies these before any change.

## Adding things

- **Package:** create `<tier>/setup/<pkgmgr>/<pkg>.sh` (macOS `brew`; Linux
  `pacman`/`yay`/`flatpak`/`asdf`/`app`; Windows `winget`). For name-based
  managers **the filename minus `.sh` must equal the skip-check identifier** —
  the package leaf name for brew/pacman/yay (e.g. `aws-cli-v2.sh` to match
  `pacman -Q aws-cli-v2`), the full dotted winget id for winget
  (e.g. `Mozilla.Firefox.sh`).
- **System tweak:** create `<tier>/setup/tweak/<name>.sh`. Runs every bootstrap,
  so make it idempotent.
- **New app config:** create `<app>/` under the relevant tier. On macOS/Linux no
  `.gitignore` edits are needed — the conventional deny-list tracks it, and it's
  symlinked into `~/.config` automatically. On Windows, also add a
  `windows/.links` line mapping the app to its destination (Windows configs are
  not auto-deployed by directory).

## Runtime state & secrets

Because config dirs are whole-dir symlinks, anything an app **writes** into its
config dir (e.g. zsh's self-compiled `.zshrc.zwc`, `.zsh_history`, micro's
`backups/`) lands in the repo tree — so those runtime/generated paths are
gitignored. `.gitignore` is a conventional deny-list (everything tracked by
default; cruft, logs, and runtime state ignored).

A **gitleaks pre-commit hook** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, installed by the
bootstrap) scans every staged change and blocks commits containing secrets.

Tracked shell scripts (`*.sh`, `setup.sh`) and the Windows manifest
(`windows/.links`) are pinned to **LF** line endings via `.gitattributes`, so
they keep working under bash — including Git Bash on Windows — regardless of
your local `core.autocrlf` setting.

## Branches

A **single branch** carries all machines; the OS is selected at runtime by
`setup.sh`. (This replaced the old branch-per-machine model.)
