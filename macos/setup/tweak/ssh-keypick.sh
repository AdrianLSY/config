# here never aborts the rest of the bootstrap.

# The helper lives at bin/ssh-keypick and is executed by OpenSSH Match exec (by
# absolute path), not sourced. On connect it probes/caches the right key per
# host, and excludes hosts you've already pinned an IdentityFile for (and
# github.com) so it never disturbs the per-repo git account selection in
# rc.d/git-multi-account.zsh.
